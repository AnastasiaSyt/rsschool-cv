## About Me:
I have been a graphic designer for ten years. Last year I completed courses ux/ui design. Now Iâ€™m interested in how design comes to life with code. My goal is to learn a JavaScript at a good level. 
I finished JavaScript/Front-end Course Stage 0. With a passion to design and develop, I want to work as a front-end developer where I could create digital magic and elevate user experience to the next level.

## Skills:
* Figma
* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* HTML&CSS
* Git
* JavaScript Basics

## Code example:
```
function highAndLow(numbers){
  numbers = numbers.split(' ');
  return `${Math.max(...numbers)} ${Math.min(...numbers)}`;
}
```
